# Alert Tracking

> This documentation applies to Weather Alerts version 2026.1.0 and newer.
>  
> Behavior and configuration may differ in earlier versions.

The integration maintains a persistent `alert_tracking` list to track the lifecycle of alerts.

## Status Values

- new: Alert first observed
- old: Alert still active
- delete: Alert removed from the API feed

## Persistence

Alert tracking data is preserved across Home Assistant restarts.

## Deletion Behavior

Alerts marked as delete remain in the tracking list for 10 minutes before being removed.
