# Alert Deduplication

> This documentation applies to Weather Alerts version 2026.1.0 and newer.
>  
> Behavior and configuration may differ in earlier versions.

Alert deduplication is an optional feature.

When enabled, alerts with identical descriptions are grouped together internally.

The integration processes the internally grouped duplicates and retains a single alert using the following priority:

1. Newest sent timestamp
2. Latest expires timestamp
3. Highest alert ID

Deduplication is disabled by default and is not recommended unless the user understands the implications.

The implication is the potential for severe weather alerts not triggering a notification if a new alert is omitted from the sensor as a duplicate. While it _shouldn't_ happen, there are absolutely no guarantees that it won't happen.
